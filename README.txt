            -   Why doesn’t the fact they have as of June 2021, provided
                49 identities? Because the same reason that we should
                either self-host, or stop worrying full stop. No matter
                how “encrypted” a provider is or privacy focused even,
                if they exist in a country with laws, they’re going to
                have to listen to those laws. And when countries
                cooperate, it no longer is entirely a matter of “X
                Countries laws has no issue with this!” Needless to say
                it’s a complex situation.
